# Greatest Common Divisor

# [Euclidean Algorithm](gcd.cpp)

Computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).
* Time Complexity: O(log(n))

Slower than C++ compiler function __gcd(a,b).

# [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](extended_gcd.cpp)

Computes the Greatest Common Divisor and the x and y values such that a * x + b * y = gcd (a, b).
* Time complexity: O (log (n))
