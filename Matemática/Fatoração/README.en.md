# Factorization

# [Simple factorization](naive_factorize.cpp)
Factorates a number N.
* Time complexity: O(N^(1/2))

# [Fast factorization](fast_factorize.cpp)
Uses Pollar-Rho and Miller-Rabin (look at Primes) to factorate a number N.
* Time complexity: O(N^(1/4) * log(N))

# [Pollar-Rho](pollard-rho.cpp)
Discovers a divisor of a number N.
* Time complexity: O(N^(1/4) * log(N))
* Space complexity: O(N^(1/2))
