# Fast Fourier transform
Computes polynomials multiplication.
* Time complexity (average case): O(N * log(N))
* Time complexity (due to high overhead rate): O(N * log(N) * log(log(N)))

It's guaranteed that there is no precision error for polynomials of degree up to 3 * 10^5 and constants up to 10^6.
