# [Interval Tree](interval_tree.cpp) (Rare)
*By Rafael Granza de Mello*

Able to return all intervals that intersect [L, R]. **L and R included** \
Contains insert ({L, R, ID}), erase ({L, R, ID}), overlaps (L, R) and find ({L, R, ID}) functions.\
It is necessary to insert and delete indicating both the limits and the interval ID.

* Time complexity: O(N * log(N)).
